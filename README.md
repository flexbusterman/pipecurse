# PipeCurse

## Purpose
It would be great to have a TUI with similar functionality to [qpwgraph](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/rncbc/qpwgraph) (a GUI that manages PipeWire nodes and connections), so I'm attempting to learn Ncurses using Python to make it.
Contributions and suggestions are greatly appreciated!

## Planned Functionality
- Detect connected devices / nodes
	- Parse output from pw-cli
- Presets
	- Save
	- Load
- Keyboard driven
	- Vim keys
	- Arrow keys
